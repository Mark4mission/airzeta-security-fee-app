## 7. Security Level — Your Station

Navigate to **Security Level** from the left sidebar.

This is your station's threat level management page. You are responsible for keeping your station's security level current and accurate.

### 7.1 Overview

The Security Level page allows you to:
- View and change your station's current threat level
- Name and configure multiple threat levels (typically 3–5)
- Optionally assign colors to levels for visual identification
- Document action guidelines for each level
- Track the history of all level changes

### 7.2 Viewing Your Current Threat Level

At the top of the page, after the header, you'll see the **Current Threat Level** section. It displays:
- A row of **level buttons** — one for each defined security level
- The **currently active level** is highlighted with a colored border, slight scale-up, and glow effect
- The **effective date** shown below the buttons ("Effective since: YYYY-MM-DD")

### 7.3 Changing the Active Security Level

To change your station's current threat level:

1. In the "Current Threat Level" section, click the button for the **new level** you want to activate.
2. The selected button becomes highlighted immediately.
3. The **effective date** automatically updates to today's date (you can manually adjust it using the date picker).
4. A new entry is automatically added to the **Level Change History** recording the change (from → to).
5. Click **Save Configuration** at the bottom to persist the change.

> **Critical**: Always click **Save Configuration** after making changes. Unsaved changes are lost if you navigate away.

### 7.4 Configuring Level Names

In the "Security Levels Configuration" section:

1. Each level has a numbered row with a text input field.
2. Type a descriptive name for each level (e.g., "Normal", "Elevated", "High Alert", "Critical").
3. To **add a new level**, click the **+ Add Level** button.
4. To **remove a level**, click the red trash icon at the end of that level's row.

**Color Auto-Detection**: If your level name includes a color word (Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Red, or their Korean equivalents), a color is automatically assigned.

> **Tip**: Use clear, descriptive level names that your team can easily understand at a glance.

### 7.5 Optional Color Assignment

Colors are optional and help with visual identification:

1. Click the **"Colors (Optional)"** toggle button in the configuration header.
2. When enabled, a color picker appears next to each level name.
3. Choose a color by clicking the color swatch and selecting from the palette.
4. To remove an assigned color, click the small **X** button next to the color swatch.
5. Levels without explicit colors default to a neutral blue display.

**Auto-detected colors**: If you type a color keyword in the level name (e.g., "Green Alert"), the system automatically assigns the matching color.

### 7.6 Setting Action Guidelines

In the **"Action Guidelines per Level"** section:

1. Each level has a corresponding text area for action descriptions.
2. Write concise instructions describing what actions should be taken at this security level.
3. Example guidelines:
   - **Normal**: "Standard security procedures in effect. Routine screening protocols."
   - **Elevated**: "Enhanced screening and monitoring. Additional random inspections."
   - **High Alert**: "Maximum screening. All cargo manually inspected. Restricted zone access only."

These guidelines serve as a quick reference for your on-ground security personnel.

### 7.7 Viewing Level Change History

The **Level Change History** section is located below the guidelines:

1. Click the section header to **expand or collapse** it (toggle arrow).
2. The badge next to the title shows the **total number** of recorded changes.
3. Each history entry displays:
   - **Date** of the change (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - **From → To** transition (with the target level name colored if it has an assigned color)
   - A colored left border matching the target level
4. The list is scrollable (up to 280px height) and sorted newest-first.
5. A maximum of 50 entries are retained.

### 7.8 Deleting History Entries

If a history entry was created by mistake (e.g., accidentally clicking the wrong level), you can delete it:

1. **Expand** the Level Change History section.
2. Find the entry you want to delete.
3. Click the **trash icon** (🗑) on the right side of the entry.
4. A confirmation dialog appears: **"Delete this history entry?"**
5. Click **OK** to delete, or **Cancel** to keep it.
6. **Save Configuration** to persist the deletion.

> **Warning**: Deleted history entries cannot be recovered after saving. Only delete entries that are genuinely incorrect.

- **Red button** = ready to save
